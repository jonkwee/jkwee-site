                    I have a major in Computer Science and a minor in Applied Mathematics.
                    During my free time, I enjoy reading and researching random topics to broaden my horizon and increase my skillset. I am currently indulging myself in culinary skills. From a professional standpoint, I am currently learning Android Development using Kotlin.
